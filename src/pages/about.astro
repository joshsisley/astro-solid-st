          I always thought my dream was to be a meteorologist for institutions that focused on severe storm research.

        <p class="leading-tight text-3xl md:text-4xl text-gray-400 dark:text-slate-500 mb-12">
          It seemed like an appropriate dream at the time because of my interest in storm chasing. I loved going storm chasing and in particular the thrill that it gave me when I was able to watch a storm go from a small cloud to a large supercell. This guided me to get my degree in Meteorology, but in the end, I just felt like it was not what I was supposed to do.

          Shortly after graduating, I took some time to try and find the spark that I was missing. I found that spark with the first web development tutorial that I started. Since then, I can not get enough. Programming to me is much like watching a powerful supercell go from a small cloud to the towering anvil. With programming, I am able to build a powerful and robust application starting from scratch. The same thrill that I got from storm chasing is the same thrill I now get with building brand new applications.

        <p class="leading-tight text-3xl md:text-4xl text-gray-400 dark:text-slate-500 mb-12">
          So now, in this industry, my passion and the thrill I get remains the same. I love that there is always more to learn, more problems to solve, and more to build.
